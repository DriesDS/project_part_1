	hmatrices is a program to manipulate matrices in different ways.
	It can manipulate matrices in a rank-k approximation and it can
	solve a certain integral equation
			
		Matrices can either be full or in a rank-k approximation.
		Matrices are read on std_in in the given format:
		
		full matrix:						rank-k approximation:

		full matrix [{m} x {n}]				rank-{k} matrix [{m} x {n}]
		...matrix(1,1:n)...					...A(1,1:k)...
		...matrix(2,1:n)...					...A(2,1:k)...
		   .........						   .......
		...matirx(m,1:n)...					...A(m,1:k)...
											-----------
											...B(1,1:k)...
											...B(2,1:k)...
											   .......
											...B(n,1:k)...

		Where in the rank-k approximation the matrix = U*S*V^t the singular
		value decomposition and A = U*S and B = V

	the program can be used from the terminal as $ ./hmatrices [-t] {cmd}
	with -t optional and {cmd} one of the following:

		help:
		shows you the help file with the explanation of all the possible commands

		test:
		executes all the tests and shows the results

		full:
		reads a rank-k matrix from std_in and converts it to a full matrix.
		This matrix is given on std_out.

		lowrank [rank k | epsabs e_abs | epsrel e_rel]:
		reads a matrix from std_in and gives the rank_k matrix on std_out
