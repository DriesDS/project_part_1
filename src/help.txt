	hmatrices is a program to manipulate matrices in different ways.
	It can manipulate matrices in a rank-k approximation and it can
	solve a certain integral equation
			
		Matrices can either be full or in a rank-k approximation.
		Matrices are read on stdin in the given format:
		
		full matrix:                        rank-k approximation:

		full matrix [{m} x {n}]             rank-{k} matrix [{m} x {n}]
		...matrix(1,1:n)...                 ...A(1,1:k)...
		...matrix(2,1:n)...                 ...A(2,1:k)...
		   .........                           .......
		...matirx(m,1:n)...                 ...A(m,1:k)...
		                                    -----------
		                                    ...B(1,1:k)...
		                                    ...B(2,1:k)...
		                                       .......
		                                    ...B(n,1:k)...

		Where in the rank-k approximation the matrix = U*S*V^t the singular
		value decomposition and A = U*S and B = V

	the program can be used from the terminal as $ ./hmatrices [-t] {cmd}
	with -t optional and {cmd} one of the following:

		help:
			shows you the help file with the explanation of all the possible 
			commands

		test:
			executes all the tests and shows the results

		full:
			reads a rank-k matrix from stdin and converts it to a full matrix.
			This matrix is given on std_out.

		lowrank [rank k | epsabs e_abs | epsrel e_rel]:
			Reads a matrix from stdin and gives the rank_k approximation on
			stdout. The method can be specified with one of three possibilities:
			rank epsabs or epsrel. If none of them is specified, the method
			choses himself a rank.

		matprod:
			Reads two matrices from stdin and gives the product on stdout.
			If one or two matrices is given as an approximation, the output
			is of the lowest rank.

		makeGFull N:
			Calculates the matrix necessary for the calculation of the integral
			equation. It gives the matrix in the matrix convention on stdout.

		solveIntFull N:
			Reads a 2xL matrix x from stdin. The method then calculates the same
			matrix as in makeGFull and prints u (the solution of the integral 
			equation) in the points specified in x on stdout. The argument N
			specifies the number of terms used in the approximation.

		plotField N:
			Reads as in solveIntFull a 2xL matrix x and
