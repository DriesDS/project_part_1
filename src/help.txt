	hmatrices is a program to manipulate matrices in different ways.
	It can manipulate matrices in a rank-k approximation and it can
	solve a certain integral equation
			
		Matrices can either be full or in a rank-k approximation.
		Matrices are read on stdin in the given format:
		
		full matrix:                        rank-k approximation:

		full matrix [{m} x {n}]             rank-{k} matrix [{m} x {n}]
		...matrix(1,1:n)...                 ...A(1,1:k)...
		...matrix(2,1:n)...                 ...A(2,1:k)...
		   .........                           .......
		...matirx(m,1:n)...                 ...A(m,1:k)...
		                                    -----------
		                                    ...B(1,1:k)...
		                                    ...B(2,1:k)...
		                                       .......
		                                    ...B(n,1:k)...

		Where in the rank-k approximation the matrix = U*S*V^t the singular
		value decomposition and A = U*S and B = V

	the program can be used from the terminal as $ ./hmatrices [-t] {cmd}
	with -t optional and {cmd} one of the following:

		help:
			shows you the help file with the explanation of all the possible 
			commands

		test:
			executes all the tests and shows the results

		full:
			reads a rank-k matrix from stdin and converts it to a full matrix.
			This matrix is given on std_out.

		lowrank [rank k | epsabs e_abs | epsrel e_rel]:
			Reads a matrix from stdin and gives the rank_k approximation on
			stdout. The method can be specified with one of three possibilities:
			rank epsabs or epsrel. If none of them is specified, the method
			choses himself a rank.

		matprod:
			Reads two matrices from stdin and gives the product on stdout.
			If one or two matrices is given as an approximation, the output
			is of the lowest rank.

		makeGFull N:
			Calculates the matrix necessary for the calculation of the integral
			equation. It gives the matrix in the matrix convention on stdout.

		makeGHmat N y:
			Calculates the H-matrix. N is the number of terms used, it should be
			a power of 2. The other argument y shoulc be positive. It prints the
			number of floats in the H-matrix.

		vecProdHmat N y:
			Calculates the H-matrix as in 'makeGHmat' with the same arguments N
			and y. Then it reads a matrix x, Nx1 full matrix, and prints the
			product of the H-matrix and x on stdout.

		solveIntFull N:
			Reads a 2xL matrix x from stdin. The method then calculates the same
			matrix as in makeGFull and prints u (the solution of the integral 
			equation) in the points specified in x on stdout. The argument N
			specifies the number of terms used in the approximation.

		plotField N:
			Reads as in solveIntFull a 2xL matrix x and 

	The option -t gives the CPU time taken by the command on stdout. If it
	is used in combination with test this will not return an exact CPU time
	because this routine uses an external system call which is not timed
	included in the timing.
